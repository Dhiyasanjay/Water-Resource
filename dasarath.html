It is the natural resource and the main constituent of our planet earth.Water is the universal solvent and plays a key role in the existence of various forms of life on the planet earth. It is widely used for various purposes such as washing, bathing, cleaning, cooking, drinking, and other industrial and domestic uses. Water is a colourless and odourless substance that is essential for the survival of living beings.There are various sources of water such as wells, rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, big dams, and streams. As we all know,nearly 70 to 80 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface is covered by water,among which only 1-2 per cent water is pure and suitable for human use.</p> <h1 align="center">A brief explanation about methods to conserve</h1> <h2>Check your toilet for leaks:Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the bowl., you have a leak that may be wasting more than 100 gallons of water a day. <h3>Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank:Put an inch or two of sand or pebbles in the bottom of a one liter bottle to weigh it down. Fill the rest of the bottle with water and put it in your toilet tank, safely away from the operating mechanism.If your tank is big enough, you may even be able to put in two bottles.In an average home, the bottle may save five gallons or more of water every day without harming the efficiency of the toilet. <h4>Install water-saving shower heads or flow restrictors:Your hardware or plumbing supply store stocks inexpensive shower heads or flow restrictors that will cut your shower flow to about three gallons a minute instead of five to ten.They are easy to install, and your showers will still be cleansing and refreshing.
