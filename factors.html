      <p>Water pollution is caused due to several reasons Sewage And Waste Water:Sewage, garbage and liquid waste of households, agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers.These wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants. It is very important to prevent the polluting of water bodies and remove existing contaminants or reducing the concentration of these contaminants so as to make it fit for desired use.Following are some of the ways of treating polluted water. Septic tanks are used to treat sewage at the place of location instead of treating it in any plant or sewage system. This system is used at the individual building level.The sewage is separated into solid and liquid components and treated separately.</p> <h1 align="center">A brief explanation</h1> <h2>Water pollution is caused due to several reasons. Here are the few major causes of water pollution: <h3>Sewage And Waste Water: Sewage, garbage and liquid waste of households, agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers. These wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants. <h4>Dumping: Dumping of solid wastes and litters in water bodies causes huge problems. Litters include glass, plastic, aluminum, styrofoam etc. Different things take different amount of time to degrade in water. They affect aquatic plants and animals. <h5>Industrial Waste: Industrial waste contains pollutants like asbestos, lead, mercury and petrochemicals which are extremely harmful to both people and environment. Industrial waste is discharged into lakes and rivers by using fresh water making the water contaminated.</p>
